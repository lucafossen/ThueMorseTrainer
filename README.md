# SequencePlayer
 Try tapping the Thue-Morse sequence for a high score! Begin by choosing either the left or right side, then follow the thue-morse sequence from there.

## TODO:

### UX:

 * [x] Arrows on each pad for readability
 * [] Make buttons respond visually to mouse down presses
 * [] Make power milestones more obvious when reached
   * [x] unique colors
   * [] score text bounces/dilates
 * [] Make the actual sequence more obvious (some cool thue-morse animation?)
 * [] add a restart button
 * [] add a quit button

### Code:

 * [] more and better comments
 * [] improve sound responsiveness
 * [] clean up the mess that is indicator.py
 * [] add resize support
